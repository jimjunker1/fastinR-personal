Title: Fatty Acids and Stable Isotopes in R
Version: 0.5
Date: 2017-03-06
Author: Philipp Neubauer
Maintainer: Philipp Neubauer <neubauer.phil@gmail.com>
Description: This packages provides functions to perfom Bayesian estiamtion of
    diet proportions based on fatty acid profiles, stable isotopes and their
    combination. Bayesian estiamtion is currently performed using the R package
    rjags to call JAGS from R. JAGS needs to be installed outside of R. The
    package can handle covariates and grouped (e.g., regional) data as
    predictors of diet proportions, and will estiamte both individual and
    popualtion level diet proportions. Facilities for simulating, plotting and
    extracting/writing summary statistics to file are provided as well.
