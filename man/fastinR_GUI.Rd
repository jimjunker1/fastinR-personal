\alias{fastinR_GUI}
\title{GUI for the fastinR set of functions}
\usage{
fastinR_GUI()
}
\description{
Provides a gui to input data to be analysed with the \code{\link{run_MCMC}} function. The gui rolls the functionality of most of the functions contained within fastinR into a single interface, but some options (plottin options mainly) are not available through the gui.
}
\details{
Disclaimer: R gui facilities are somewhat unstable and have a mind of their own. Often unloading the package and re-loading it will fix glitches, but not always. Therefore, the command line is the suggested way to use the package.

\section{Warning}{
 The Tcl/Tk gui interface is very unpredictable, leading to odd errors like internal functions not being found when calling FASTIN functions from the console after having used the GUI. Problems seem to be related to environments. It's usually best to completely restart R when this happens.
