\title{Fatty Acids and Stable Isotopes in R}
\description{
This packages provides standalone functions and gui facilities to perfom Bayesian estiamtion of diet proportions based on fatty acid profiles, stable isotopes and their combination. Bayesian estiamtion is currently performed in JAGS using the R package rjags. The package can handle covariates and grouped (e.g., regional) data as predictors of diet proportions, and will estimate both individual and popualtion level diet proportions. Functionality for simulating, plotting and extracting/writing summary statistics to file is provided as well.
